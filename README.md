# Reduction-of-Phone-Screen-time-using-Implementation-Intentions
Projektseminar Forschung Sozialpsychologie: Behavior Change

**1. Objective**
   This study aims to explore how implementation intentions can reduce phone screen time and weaken the habits that drive excessive use, focusing on promoting behavioral change. With the increasing time spent on smartphones becoming a widespread concern, there is a need for strategies to manage and reduce screen time effectively. The research will evaluate whether specific plans to limit phone use can decrease screen time compared to a control group and whether these plans can lead to lasting behavioral changes. The findings will contribute to understanding effective interventions for managing screen time and encouraging healthier technology use.

**2. Research questions and hypotheses**
   By addressing the research question and these hypotheses, the study aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on effective interventions for managing smartphone usage and fostering positive behavioral change:
**Research Question:** How is phone screen time influenced by implementation intentions?

- H1: Reporting phone screen time reduces the phone screen time in both groups.
- H2: Implementation intentions to reduce phone screen time decrease phone screen time more in the Experimental group compared to the Control group.
- H3: Implementation intentions reduce habit strength significantly.

**3. Methodology**

3.1. Sample and design
After removing all the missing values and unqualified observations, the final sample comes down to a total of 13 participants (consisting of 4 males, 8 females and 1 diverse) coming from a variety of countries: Germany, Poland, Vietnam, Lithuania,... and are divided into 2 groups: The Control group and the Experimental group. Participants for each group are chosen randomly. The average age of the sample is 31.23(sd = 15.19).

3.2. Procedure
- The study was conducted over a two-week period, utilizing two surveys to measure total phone screen time during the second week compared to the first week. The first week served as a baseline, assessing each participant’s regular phone screen time. In the second week, the intervention was implemented, marking it as the test week.
- Participants completed the first survey to provide socio-demographic information (age, sex), re- spond to the Habit Strength Index (HSI) questions, and report their phone screen time for 3 days of the current week (Monday-Wednesday). For the Experimental group, implementation intentions were also recorded during this survey. The follow-up survey, conducted after the intervention, collected data on phone screen time during the same 3 days of the following week and post-intervention HSI.

3.3. Instrument development
The following instruments were developed for the study:
- HSI (Habit Strength Index)
The Habit Strength Index (HSI) is a psychological measurement tool designed to assess the strength of an individual’s habits. It quantifies how automatic, consistent, and resistant to change a particular behavior has become over time. The HSI typically evaluates factors such as the frequency of the behavior, the degree of automaticity (how much the behavior occurs without conscious thought), and the extent to which contextual cues trigger the behavior. High scores on the HSI indicate a strong habit, meaning the behavior is deeply ingrained and likely to be performed regularly with minimal conscious effort.
- The customized HSI Question set used in the survey is stated below.
For each of the following statements, respondents are typically asked to indicate how much they agree or disagree on a Likert scale (e.g., 1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree).
- Q1. ”Using my phone is something I do automatically.”
- Q2. ”Using my phone is something I do without having to consciously remember.”
- Q3. ”Using my phone is something I do without thinking.”
- Q4. ”Using my phone is something I start doing before I realize I’m doing it.”
- Q5. ”Using my phone is something I do without having to try.”
- Q6. ”Using my phone is something that would require effort not to do.”
- Q7. ”Using my phone is something I do frequently.”
- Q8. ”Using my phone is something that is typically ‘me’.”
- Q9. ”Using my phone is something I would find hard not to do.”
- Q10. ”Using my phone is something I do in the same way every time.”
- 
- Implementation intentions
The implementation requires participants to think about their phone use - when they use it the most
(IF/WHEN) and what they could do to minimize the use (THEN). They are asked to write an if-then
statement (in their native language) that would target their phone use. For example: ”If I go to sleep,
then I put my phone away”.
